Problem Statement: 
Problem Statement for MongoDB Modules and Queries
The use of MongoDB modules and the construction of effective queries present several challenges and considerations for developers and database administrators. Here's a comprehensive problem statement:
1.	Module Selection and Integration: 
o	Choosing the appropriate MongoDB driver or module for different programming languages and frameworks
o	Ensuring compatibility between the selected module version and the MongoDB server version
o	Integrating MongoDB modules seamlessly into existing application architectures
2.	Connection Management: 
o	Establishing and maintaining stable connections to MongoDB servers
o	Implementing connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
o	Handling connection errors and implementing reconnection strategies
3.	Query Construction Complexity: 
o	Building complex queries that effectively filter, sort, and manipulate data
o	Optimizing queries for performance, especially for large datasets
o	Ensuring query correctness and preventing injection vulnerabilities
4.	Error Handling and Debugging: 
o	Implementing robust error handling for various query scenarios
o	Debugging complex queries and aggregations
o	Troubleshooting performance issues in production environments
This problem statement encompasses the multifaceted challenges involved in working with MongoDB modules and constructing effective queries. Addressing these issues is crucial for developing robust, efficient, and scalable MongoDB-based applications.
Procedure:
a)	MongoDB Connection Establish with Node js

Step 1: initialize your project
npm init -y
 

Step 2: Install Mongoose in your system using the below command.
  npm install mongoose

 

Step 3: Import the mongoose library
To connect a Node.js application to MongoDB, we have to use a library called Mongoose.  
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

Step 4: Use the Mongoose connect method to establish the connection
//Connectivity code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const mongoose = require('mongoose'); 
// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/developers');
// Check connection
const db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
db.once('open', () => {
  console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
});
app.get('/getUsers',(req,res)=>{
    res.send("connected with mongdo")
})
app.listen(3003,()=>{
    console.log("it is listening")
})
 



 

Result:
MongoDB, as a flexible and powerful NoSQL database system, offers a comprehensive set of modules and query capabilities that cater to diverse data management needs.
