Solved Practical: Hands-on JS Basics, Functions, Control Statements, and Event Handling
Objective: 
The objective of this lab is to understand the basics of JavaScript, including variable declarations, data types, comments, and logging output to the console and document.
Problem Statement: 
Write an HTML and JavaScript program that demonstrates basic JavaScript syntax. The program should include variable declarations with different data types, single-line and multi-line comments, and methods to output information to the console and document.
Procedure:
1.	Open your text editor or IDE.
2.	Create a new HTML file and add the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Basics</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // This is a single-line comment
        /*
         This is a
         multi-line comment
        */
        // Variable declarations
        var myVar = "TestValue"; // string
        let myLet = 42; // number
        const myConst = true; // Boolean
        // Logging to the console
        console.log("This is a string variable:", myVar);
        console.log("This is a number variable:", myLet);
        console.log("This is a boolean variable:", myConst);
        // Writing to the document
        document.write("This is a string variable: " + myVar + "<br>");
        document.write("This is a number variable: " + myLet + "<br>");
        document.write("This is a boolean variable: " + myConst + "<br>");
    </script>
</body>
</html>
3.	Save the file with a .html extension
4.	Open the saved HTML file in your web browser to view the output. To see the console output, open the browser's developer tools (by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"), and navigate to the "Console" tab.
