Objective: 
To understand and implement JavaScript events and event handlers, including click, mouseover, mouseout, and page load events.
Problem Statement: 
Write an HTML and JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of JavaScript events and event handlers. The program should include:
•	A click event handler that displays an alert when a heading is clicked.
•	mouseover and mouseout event handlers that display an alert and log a message to the console when the mouse hovers over and leaves a button, respectively.
•	A window.onload event handler that logs a message to the console when the page is fully loaded.
Procedure:
1.	Open your text editor or IDE.
2.	Create a new HTML file and add the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Events and Event Handlers</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1 id="pageTitle">Click on Me!</h1>
    <button id="myButton">Hover over Me </button>

    <script>
        // Event handler functions
        function handleClick() {
            alert("You clicked!");
        }
        function handleMouseOver() {
            alert("Mouse over!");
        }
        function handleMouseOut() {
            console.log("Mouse out of the button!");
        }

        function handlePageLoad() {
            console.log("Page is fully loaded.");
        }



        // Get elements and attach event listeners
        let pageTitle = document.getElementById("pageTitle");
        let button = document.getElementById("myButton");
        pageTitle.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
        button.addEventListener("mouseover", handleMouseOver);
        button.addEventListener("mouseout", handleMouseOut);
        // Window onload event
        window.onload = handlePageLoad;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
3.	Save the file with a .html extension
4.	Open the saved HTML file in your web browser to view the output. To see the console output, open the browser's developer tools (by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"), and navigate to the "Console" tab.
