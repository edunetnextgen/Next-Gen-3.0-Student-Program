Objective: 
To understand and implement various types of JavaScript loops, including for, while, do-while, and for-in loops.
Problem Statement: 
Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of JavaScript loops. The program should include:
•	A for loop that iterates five times and logs the current index to the console.
•	A while loop that iterates until a condition is met and logs the current index to the console.
•	A do-while loop that iterates at least once and continues until a condition is met , writing the current index to the document.
•	A for-in loop that iterates over the properties of an object (person) and writes each key-value pair to the document.
Procedure:
1.	Open your text editor or IDE.
2.	Create a new HTML file and add the following code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Loops</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // for loop
        console.log("For Loop:");
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            console.log("i =", i);
        }

        // while loop
        console.log("While Loop:");
        let j = 0;
        while (j < 5) {
            console.log("j =", j);
            j++;
        }

        // do-while loop
        document.write("Do-While Loop:","<br>");
        let k = 0;
        do {
            document.write("k =", k,"<br>");
            k++;
        } while (k < 5);

        // for-in loop
        document.write("<br>For-In Loop:","<br>");
        let person = {
            name: "Alice",
            age: 30,
            city: "New York"
        };

        for (let key in person) {
            document.write(key + ":", person[key],"<br>");
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
3.	Save the file with a .html extension
4.	Open the saved HTML file in your web browser to view the output. To see the console output, open the browser's developer tools (by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"), and navigate to the "Console" tab.
