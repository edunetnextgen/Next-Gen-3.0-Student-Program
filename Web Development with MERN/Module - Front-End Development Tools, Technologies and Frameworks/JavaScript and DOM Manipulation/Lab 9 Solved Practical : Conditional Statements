Objective: 
The objective of this lab is to learn and implement JavaScript conditional statements, including the if-else, if-else-if, and switch statements.
Problem Statement: 
Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of JavaScript conditional statements. The program should include:
•	An if-else statement to determine if a person is a minor or an adult based on their age.
•	An if-else-if ladder to assign a grade based on a given score.
•	A switch statement to display the day of the week based on a numeric day value (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.).
Procedure:
1.	Open your text editor or IDE.
2.	Create a new HTML file and add the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Conditional Statements</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // if-else statement
        let age = 20;
        if (age < 18) {
            console.log("You are a minor.");
        } else {
            console.log("You are an adult.");
        }

        // if-else-if statement
        let score = 85;
        if (score >= 90) {
            console.log("Grade: A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
            console.log("Grade: B");
        } else if (score >= 70) {
            console.log("Grade: C");
        } else if (score >= 60) {
            console.log("Grade: D");
        } else {
            console.log("Grade: F");
        }
        // switch statement
        let day = 3;
        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                console.log("Today is Monday.");
                break;
            case 2:
                console.log("Today is Tuesday.");
                break;
            case 3:
                console.log("Today is Wednesday.");
                break;
            case 4:
                console.log("Today is Thursday.");
                break;
            case 5:
                console.log("Today is Friday.");
                break;
            case 6:
                console.log("Today is Saturday.");
                break;
            case 7:
                console.log("Today is Sunday.");
                break;
            default:
                console.log("Invalid day.");
                break;
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

3.	Save the file with a .html extension
4.	Open the saved HTML file in your web browser to view the output. To see the console output, open the browser's developer tools (by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"), and navigate to the "Console" tab.
