Creating a Complex Grid Layout
Task: Create a responsive grid layout using Bootstrap's grid system. The layout should have the following structure:

A full-width header.
A two-column layout beneath the header where the left column is twice as wide as the right column.
Below the two-column layout, create a three-column layout where the middle column is centered and the left and right columns take up the remaining space equally.
