Solved Practical: create a Functional component and use the state to calculate the interaction happened to a button 
Objective:  
The objective of this lab is to implement the hooks in a React project This includes creating of the React project and using state hooks in components and understanding the working of state in functional components using the Hooks method.
Problem Statement:
Create a button element and an element to display the number of counts of the button is clicked.
Performing the Practical: 
1.	Open VScode
2.	Create a Functional component inside the src folder.
3.	Import react state hooks and the Functional component  sniped.
4.	Call the state hooks
5.	Add the following code by editing the sniped.

import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Statehook() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Statehook

6.	Go to app.js file and add your component as shown:

import { useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import Statehook from './components/Hooks/Statehook';
function App() {
  return (
    <>
<Statehook/>
    </>
  )
